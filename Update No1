\begin{abstract}
    Both the number and the size of spatial databases are rapidly
growing because of the large amount of data obtained from
satellite images, X-ray crystallography or other scientific
equipment. Therefore, automated knowledge discovery becomes more and more important in spatial databases. So far,
most of the methods for knowledge discovery in databases
(KDD) have been based on relational database systems. In
this paper, we address the task of class identification in spatial
databases using clustering techniques. We present an interface
to the database management system (DBMS), which is crucial
for the efficiency of KDD on large databases. This interface
is based on a spatial access method, the R*-tree. It clusters the
objects according to their spatial neighborhood and supports
efficient processing of spatial queries. Furthermore, we propose a method for spatial data sampling as part of the focusing
component, significantly reducing the number of objects to be
clustered. Thus, we achieve a considerable speed-up for clustering in large databases. We have applied the proposed techniques to real data from a large protein database used for
predicting protein-protein docking. A performance evaluation
on this database indicates that clustering on large spatial databases can be performed both efficiently and effectively using
our approach.
